                Definition of Forex Trading
              </h2>
              <p>
                Forex trading is the simultaneous buying of one currency and
                selling of another. These two currencies make up what is known
                as a currency pair. Currencies are always traded in pairs, and
                each currency in a pair is represented by a three-letter code.
                For example, the US dollar and the Japanese yen make up the
                USD/JPY currency pair. When trading forex, traders are
                speculating on the value of one currency against another.
