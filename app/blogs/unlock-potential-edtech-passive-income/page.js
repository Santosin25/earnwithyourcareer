                Overview of Generating Passive Income
              </h1>
              <p>
                Generating passive income is a way to make money without
                actively working for it. Passive income can be generated through
                investments, rental properties, and other sources of income that
                require little to no effort to maintain. Passive income can
                provide a steady stream of income and can help individuals
                achieve financial freedom. It is important to understand the
                risks associated with generating passive income and to diversify
                investments in order to reduce risk.
