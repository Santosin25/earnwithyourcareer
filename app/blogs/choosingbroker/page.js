              How To Choose a Broker
            </h1>
            <p>
              This is a good question and you will get a variety of answers if
              you were to ask around in the trading community. Firstly, I would
              strongly suggest that you choose one of the bigger well known
              brokers. Trust me on this!

            <p>
              The retail forex industry is still relatively young and it does
              not have the same regulations and rules to follow as a lot of
              other traded financial instruments. This is mainly due to the fact
              that there are no central exchanges involved. But having said
              this, a lot of governments are beginning to formulate rules and
              regulations that do give forex traders better protection. But be
              warned, there are still bucket shops (dodgy brokers) out there who
              will rip you off in a heartbeat. It was only recently I heard of
              one Swiss based broker disappearing with all their clientsâ€™ funds.
            </p>
            <p>
              I certainly don&apos;t want to scare anyone off, but please be
              warned and choose wisely.There are plenty of good brokers around,
              so there is no need to panic and get stressed about this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another suggestion is that you do not place all of your funds into
              one broker, especially if you have a substantial amount. What I am
              talking about here, is if you had say $100,000 to trade (which you
              dondon&apos;t need!), I wouldn&apos;t be depositing all of this
              with the one broker. Instead, I would either spread it amongst two
              or more brokers, or keep funds in reserve and only deposit them
              with my broker if they were required - you will sleep better at
              night!
