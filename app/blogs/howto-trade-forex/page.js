            <p>
              It may seem a little confusing at first but really, it is quite
              simple.
            </p>
            <p>
              Forex is a leveraged financial instrument, as is Options, Futures,
              CFDs, Warrants etc. So this is nothing new.
            </p>
            <p>
              You trade Forex in &apos;lots&apos;. That is basically the
              industry standard, but there are brokers out there that do things
              slightly different. For example, Oanda trades in
              &apos;units&apos;, but they can be easily converted to a lot size
              equivalent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lots are known by different names, depending on how much currency
              they represent. There is a standard lot, a mini lot and a micro
              lot
            </p>

              Lot Size and Equivalent Pip Value
            </h1>
            <p>
              Just to refresh your memory, if the EUR/USD moved from 1.3924 to
              1.3928, it has moved a total of 4 pips, and if the USD/JPY moved
              from 95.23 to 95.19, it also moved 4 pips. Straightforward, so
              far.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I was trading 1 standard lot ($100,000), then each pip is worth
              US$10. So in the above EUR/USD example of the 4 pip move and you
              were trading 1 standard lot, 4 pips is equal to US$40. The same
              US$10 per pip also applies to the GBP/USD, AUD/USD and NZD/USD.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is the easy part. Now all the other forex pairs aren&apos;t
              quite as simple due to the fact that the USD is not the quoteor
              counter currency. So what you have to consider here, is the
              currency conversion between the two pairs and the math can be a
              little confusing. Me, I keep it simple, and consider all pairs to
              have a 1 pip value of US$10. Just about all of the forex pairs,
              except the EUR/GBP have a pip value of less than US$10, and most
              of these are just under that level, but they do fluctuate with
              currency variations.If you do need to know the exact pip value,
              there are plenty of free websites with a built in calculator to do
              the math for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              The majority of traders either trade standard lots or mini lots.
              As stated earlier, Oanda is slightly different here as they trade
              in units, which can be very useful for precise money management.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, if 1 pip is equal to US$10 on a standard lot (1.0 lot /
              $100,000), then 1 pip on a mini lot (0.1 lot / $10,000) must be
              equal to US$1, and 1 pip on a micro lot (0.01 lot / $1,000) is
              worth $0.10. Simple! And to keep it very easy and simplified, just
              consider every Forex pair the same. I know a USD/JPY pip on a
              standard lot isn&apos;t US$10, but it is close enough for me not
              to worry about its exact value. If your style of trading is
              affected by the exact price of pips on the Forex pair you are
              trading, then you will have to use something like a dedicated
              forex calculator to work out the exact values. They are freely
              available by just doing a Google search.

          <article className="allArticle">
            <h1 className="allArticleHeading">
              Let&apos;s get into a Trade Example:
            </h1>
            <p>
              I have $2,235 in my trading account, and I am happy to risk 2% on
              each trade.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&apos;m in my broker’s account looking at their charts and I see
              a nice set up on the EUR/USD where I am looking at buying at
              1.3928. I am going to place my stop (stop loss) 30 pips below at
              1.3898. So my risk on this trade is 30 pips.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now I need to know what my position size will be, where I am
              risking no more than 2% of my overall account balance of $2,235.
              This actually equates to $44.70.
            </p>
            <p>
              The easy way to work this out is by using the following: Account
              Balance multiplied by risk percentage, divided by risk (stop size
              in pips), equals position size.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>In this trade, the math would look something like this:</li>
              <code>
                <ul>
                  <li>$2,235 x 2% = $44.70</li>
                  <li>$44.70 / 30 pips = 1.49</li>
                </ul>
              </code>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Therefore my position size on this trade would be 1.49 mini lots
              (0.149 lots). You would have to round this down to either 1 mini
              lot (0.1 lot), or 1.4 mini lots (0.14 lots) if your platform
              allows this trading size.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are unsure of the position size, whether it is in standard
              or mini lots, just do the math backwards to confirm. You know the
              maximum risk is $44.70 on this trade. If you went into the trade
              with 1 mini lot, you know each pip is worth $1, so if you were
              stopped out, then you would have lost $30, which is under your max
              risk of $44.70, due to the fact you had rounded your position size
              down.
            </p>
            <div>
              <h6 className="underline text-indigo-600 pt-8 -mb-6 font-medium">
                Here is another example with a much larger account balance and a
                different risk percentage and stop placement.
              </h6>
            </div>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ">
              <li>
                Account balance is $37,840, your trade risk is 3%, and you are
                placing an order to sell the GBP/USD at 1.4562 with a stop at
                1.4607, which is 45 pips away.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> Let&apos;s do the math to work out my position size:</p>
                <code>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      $37,840 (Account balance) x 3% (risk percentage) =
                      $1135.20
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      $1135.20 (max risk) divided by 45 (stop) = 25.226&apos;
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </code>
              </li>
              <li>
                Therefore my position size would be 25.226&apos; mini lots
                (2.5226 lots), or rounded down to 25.2 mini lots (2.52 lots)
                which is basically 2.5 standard lots.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do the math in reverse if you want to double check your position
                size. You know your max risk is $1135.20, and your stop is 45
                pips, and each pip is worth $10 on a standard lot. If you were
                to lose 45 pips with 2.5 lots, then 45 x 2.5 x 10 = 1125, which
                is under the $1135.20 risk.
              </li>
              <li>
                It may be a little confusing at first, but it is very simple
                once you get the hang of it. By using this formula, you should
                never have to worry about leverage, margin or risk. They just
                don&apos;t come into it. But having said that, it all depends on
                your risk percentage levels and your actual trading methods. You
                do need a successful trading method, because if you don&apos;t
                and you were only risking say 2% per trade, you will eventually
                blow out your account. It will just take a bit longer to achieve
                this than if you were risking 10% on each trade.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are plenty of freely available Excel type spreadsheets
                that can do the math for you once you plug in your own figures.
                These are quite handy and ensure you get the figures correct.
              </li>
              <li>Now we need to talk about risk!</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
          <article className="allArticle">
            <ul className="list-inside ">
              <li>
                I consider &apos;risk&apos; to be a very important issue when it
                comes to Forex trading. Probably not so much of an issue if you
                are a longer timeframe style trader, say the weekly or monthly
                charts, but if you are a day trader, then it certainly is an
                issue. TRUST ME ON THIS!
              </li>
              <li>
                Now I don&apos;t really care what your percentage risk is per
                trade as that is up to the individual trader. I have suggested
                2-3% which is quite common amongst successful traders, even less
                is better according to some. This will ensure you stay in the
                game longer at least. If you want to risk 10% on a trade, that
                is up to you. But I will say that it is very much in your
                interest to have a physical stop loss in place. This is a point
                where you will be taken out of a trade if something does go
                wrong .
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>What can go wrong you ask?</li>
              <li>
                Other than you picked the wrong direction for the trade, which
                will happen every now and then. You may also have internet
                problems or the biggie, unfavourable news comes out that
                completely catches you by surprise and before you know it, your
                trade is down a 100 pips or so.
              </li>
              <li>
                First up, there are potential internet problems. It doesn&apos;t
                matter where you live, you can never be guaranteed of 100%
                reliable internet connection. It only takes a storm within about
                100kms of my place to disconnect me at times, and I&apos;m with
                the biggest telco in the land. When I was trading full time back
                in the mid 2000s, I also had a backup with the old dial up to my
                cable broadband. These days, you can get the wireless modem as a
                backup. One other thing I would strongly suggest is that you
                have your broker&apos;s phone number handy, so you can ring them
                direct and either close trades or move stops etc. I have done
                this in the past to get out of trouble, and it is nice to know
                that you have this option if worse comes to worse. Again, this
                may only be available with the bigger well known brokers. It
                also helps to consider any possible language problems if you
                have to get on the phone.
              </li>
              <li>
                Potentially the biggest problem is news releases or unexpected
                news. Forex moves on news! And there is always plenty of news
                coming out. The good thing about it, is that most of the news is
                released at set times which is very easy to keep track of. Very
                easy, and I&apos;ll go into this in another chapter.
              </li>
              <li>
                So what am I saying here? MAKE SURE YOU USE STOPS ON ALL TRADES.
                I cannot be any clearer on this!
              </li>
              <li>
                Now the stop depends on you, but please don&apos;t make it a
                mental stop. These just don&apos;t work in Forex trading,
                especially if trading the smaller time frames. Even if you have
                some sort of safety stop that is some distance from your entry
                to prevent total wipe-out, which you can adjust later once the
                trade is up and running, is a much better option than having no
                stop at all.
              </li>
              <li>
                To give you an example of price movement in a 24hr period, I
                believe the average for the EUR/USD is around 100 pips and the
                GBP/USD is about 120 pips, give or take. That is just an average
                move in 24hrs. When I say move, it may start and finish at the
                same price, so I am referring to a possible range of movement
                here. If you were trading 1 standard lot and the market moved
                100 pips against you, then you would be $1,000 in the red. Not
                good! If you are not sure what a stop is: it is an order to
                close out your trade automatically if the trade goes against you
                by a predetermined amount.

              <li>An example:</li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Bought EUR/USD at 1.3950, and obviously wanting it to increase
                in price to profit. You decided you did not want to risk more
                than 30 pips on this trade for whatever reason, so you would
                place your stop at 1.3920. If price fell to this level, you
                would be automatically closed out of the trade by your
                broker&apos;s platform for a maximum 30 pip loss. It
                wouldn&apos;t matter if you were online or at the beach as it
                all happens automatically.

                Using stops is a simple part of the whole forex trading
                experience, and an important one at that. They are easy to place
                at the start of the trade and easy to adjust once the trade is
                up and running. I strongly suggest that you use them at all
                times to avoid the unexpected.

                Having said all that, there are certain

                that don’t use stops. However, they normally have some other
                mechanism built in to assist with trade management when price
                goes against you. Generally these types of trading systems are
                not suitable for those who are not comfortable trading this way
                and who do require some further expertise to be successful. For
                now, just place a stop on all trades and then you can look into
                more exotic trading methods sometime in the future.
